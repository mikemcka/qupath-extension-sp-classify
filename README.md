## This java extension provides similar functionality as parts of CellTune by the Keren Lab in QuPath. If you use this tool for your analysis please also cite [the CellTune paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-026-03162-2).

📖 **Full documentation: [mikemcka.github.io/qupath-extension-sp-classify](https://mikemcka.github.io/qupath-extension-sp-classify/)**

A [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) 0.7 extension that brings **human in the loop ative learning** to cell classification. It trains two gradient-boosted models (XGBoost + LightGBM) simultaneously, identifies cells where the models disagree, and presents those disputed cells for human review — creating an iterative loop that progressively improves classification accuracy.


## Features

- **Dual-model disagreement detection** — two *different* models (default **XGBoost + LightGBM**; **Random Forest** also available) train on the same labels, and the cells where they disagree are flagged for review. Training runs on the CPU.
- **Weighted uncertainty sampling** — disagreement cells are drawn with a 5-tier strategy (FOV balance → most-confused classes → rare types → user-specified confusions → random fill) so review effort lands where it matters instead of on easy or already-covered cells.
- **Interactive review mode** — step cell-by-cell through the sampled disagreements and accept a model's prediction (or override it) with one click, with per-cell spatial context.

See **[User Guide §7 — Review mode](USER_GUIDE.md#7-after-training--review-mode)** for the full tier breakdown and review toolbar, and **[§5](USER_GUIDE.md#5-multi-class-workflow-in-detail)** for training settings.


## The Active Learning Loop

```
① Seed labels via Manual label mode
                    │
                    ▼
② Train dual classifiers (XGBoost + LightGBM)
                    │
                    ▼
③ View inter-model confusion matrix
   → per-class agreement rates
                    │
                    ▼
④ Enter review mode → choose sample size
   → step through disagreement cells
   → assign or correct labels
                    │
                    ▼
   ⟳ Merge new labels → retrain → repeat
     until satisfied with classification quality
```

## Requirements

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| QuPath | 0.7.0 or later |
| Java | 25 (required by QuPath 0.7) |

The extension JAR bundles XGBoost4J, LightGBM4J, and a pure-Java Random Forest — no separate ML library installation is needed.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `qupath-extension-sp-classify-*-all.jar` from the [Releases](../../releases) page (or build from source — see below)
2. **If upgrading, delete any older `qupath-extension-sp-classify-*-all.jar` from the extensions directory first.** QuPath loads every JAR it finds there, so leaving an old version behind means the stale extension may load instead of the new one (you'll see old behaviour even after "updating"). Only one such JAR should be present.
3. Drag and drop the JAR onto the QuPath window, or copy it to your QuPath extensions directory:
   - **Windows:** `C:\Users\<you>\QuPath\v0.7\extensions\`
   - **Linux:** `~/.local/share/QuPath/v0.7/extensions/`
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/QuPath/v0.7/extensions/`

   (In QuPath, *Extensions > Installed extensions* opens this folder directly.)
4. Restart QuPath — the extension appears under **Extensions > SP Classify**

## Quick Start

1. **Open a project** with an image that has cell detections (run *Analyze > Cell detection* first if needed)
2. **Label seed cells** — create point annotations on detected cells, then set the annotation's class (e.g. `CD4T`, `Bcell`, `Macrophage`). Aim for ≥20-30 cells per class.
3. **Set up a channel mapping** (optional) — *Extensions > SP Classify > Channel Mapping (Review Display)...* — pick which image channels review should show for each cell type (saved per project; no limit on channels per class). Alternatively import a CSV via *Import Marker Table*, which is also the way to share a mapping between projects
4. **Select features** (optional) — *Extensions > SP Classify > Select Features* — choose which measurements to include in training. Features are shown in a grouped, searchable checkbox tree (one group per marker, plus Morphology / Shape, Neighbors, Embeddings, and Other / Uncategorized) so 1000+-column panels stay navigable.
5. **Clustering normalisation** (optional, clustering-only) — *Extensions > SP Classify > Clustering Normalisation* — apply arcsinh or sqrt transforms to selected features for the clustering / scatter-plot / gating workflows (the classifier always trains and predicts on raw values). Match the cofactor to your intensity scale: ~25–50 for raw fluorescence panels (COMET, CODEX; scale-dependent) or 0.05 for MIBI mass spectrometry (Hartmann et al. 2021; see [References](#references)).
6. **Train** — click *Train* in the SP Classify panel (or *Extensions > SP Classify > Run Classification…*). If features haven't been selected yet, you'll be prompted to select them or use all. A confirmation dialog shows the feature and label counts, **Model 1** and **Model 2** type selectors (default: XGBoost + LightGBM), resampling, auto-tune, and early stopping options. If the project has multiple images, a dual-list image selector lets you choose which images to apply the trained classifier to. A progress dialog shows real-time training status.
7. **Plot confusions** — click *Plot Confusions* to see the inter-model confusion matrix with per-class agreement rates and F1 scores
8. **Feature importance** (optional) — *Extensions > SP Classify > Feature Importance…* — opens a bar chart of the top 10 features by mean |SHAP| value with a class selector. Alternatively tick **"Show top 10 feature importance after training"** in the training dialog to show it automatically.
9. **Review** — click *Enter Review Mode*. You'll be prompted for how many disagreement cells to review (default 200), then step through disputed cells one-by-one. Each cell shows coloured prediction buttons (e.g. `XGB: CD4 (87%)`, `LGB: Bcell (65%)`) — click to accept. Use the *All Classes* dropdown if neither prediction is correct. If you switch to a different image, the trained classifier is automatically applied so you can review that image immediately.
10. **Retrain** — after reviewing, click Train again. The confusion matrix should improve. Repeat until satisfied.
11. **Export** — *Export Cell Table* opens a column picker (same search/prefix/select-all controls as *Select Features*) so you can choose which measurement columns to export, with an optional tick-box to include cell polygons in micron or pixel coordinates, then saves all cells as CSV. *Export AnnData* exports AnnData-compatible CSV with a Python H5AD conversion script. *Export Ground Truth* saves labelled cells for transfer to other images.

### Marker Table Format For Automated Channel Switching

The recommended way to build the mapping is the **Channel Mapping editor** (*Extensions > SP Classify >
Channel Mapping (Review Display)...*, or **Edit channel mapping…** in the Review Mode window): pick a
cell type, tick the image channels review should show. The mapping is saved per project to
`<project>/celltune/marker-table.json`. A CSV remains the import / export / sharing route.

The simple CSV format has `Marker1`–`Marker5` columns plus any further `Marker…` columns (no upper
limit). Trailing columns may be left blank. A ready-to-edit
example is provided at [`examples/marker-table-example.csv`](examples/marker-table-example.csv).

```csv
CellType,Marker1,Marker2,Marker3,Marker4,Marker5
CD4T,CD4,CD3,,,
Bcell,CD20,,,,
Macrophage,CD68,CD163,CD11b,,
Treg,CD4,CD25,FOXP3,CD3,
```

The `CellType` column should match the class names you use for your labelled cells. Matching is
tolerant of case, spacing, and punctuation (so `CD4 T`, `cd4t`, and `CD4-T` are treated as the
same type), and `Marker` names are matched to image channels the same way — a channel named
`CD3 (Opal 570)` still matches the marker `CD3`. If a predicted type isn't found in the table, or
none of its markers match any channel, the viewer's channels are left unchanged.

If a CSV picks the wrong channels, open the editor, **Import CSV…**, look for `~` / `!` / `✗` rows, fix
the ticks, **Pin all matches**, then **Save**. See [Marker table format](docs/marker-table.md) for details.
